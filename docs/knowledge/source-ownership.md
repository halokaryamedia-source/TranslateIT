# TranslateIT Source Ownership

This file maps semantic responsibility to the current owner. It does not carry milestone status or proof results.

## Navigation questions

```text
Who owns this?        → source-ownership.md
What must it do?      → docs/foundation/
What is active?       → next-action.md
What is proven?       → current-validation.md
Why was it chosen?    → decisions/
What happens now?     → current source + matching proof
```

Historical paths/branch names never become current owners merely because an old report references them.
