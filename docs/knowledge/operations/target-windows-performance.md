# Target Windows Performance Acceptance

Use this runbook after the exact current `Local` source checks are green. It owns one repeatable TARGET_WINDOWS baseline for performance decisions; it is not a milestone/status report.

## Purpose

Measure the real installed/local Meeting path before changing safety, model residency, or transport architecture:

```text
physical microphone
→ finalized utterance
→ ASR
→ Indonesian → English translation
→ selected Meeting voice
→ TranslateIT Meeting Microphone
→ meeting application
```

The baseline must distinguish speech-boundary delay, CPU/audio preparation, AI stages, output delivery, and hardware pressure. Do not infer any target result from CI/source presence.

## Preconditions

- Use the exact `Local` SHA being evaluated and record it before starting.
- Start with a built-in Meeting voice so My Voice training is not a prerequisite.
- Use the actual physical microphone intended for normal use.
- Configure the exact TranslateIT Meeting Microphone / supported virtual route used by the meeting application.
- Keep optional incoming Meeting Sound **off for the first outbound baseline**.
- Close unrelated GPU/CPU-heavy applications where practical, but keep the actual meeting application running for the end-to-end pass.
- Do not tune VAD, remove safety checks, unload models, or replace WAV transport before the first baseline is recorded.

## Record the environment

Record these once with the baseline:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| `Local` SHA | |
| Windows version/build | |
| CPU | |
| Physical RAM | |
| GPU | |
| Dedicated VRAM | |
| GPU driver | |
| Microphone + source format | |
| Meeting application | |
| Meeting microphone endpoint | |
| Selected TranslateIT voice | |
| Incoming Meeting Sound enabled? | No for baseline |

Do not record private conversation text, raw recordings, credentials, or unredacted private paths as evidence.

## Test order

### 1. A2 / A3 — acceleration and ASR truth

Open Diagnostics and confirm the executed runtime reports the actual selected device/precision. Run the normal required readiness path and confirm ASR loads and processes a valid finalized input.

Record:

- selected ASR device and compute type;
- selected translation device and precision;
- whether CPU fallback is active;
- any CUDA/runtime blocker.

A file existing or CUDA being installed is not execution proof.

### 2. B1 / B2 / B5 — microphone, finalization and route

Verify the selected/default microphone functionally produces capture frames. Start Session Listening and speak several short, normal Indonesian sentences with natural pauses.

Confirm:

- capture frames continue arriving;
- natural pauses produce finalized utterances;
- no repeated callback error appears;
- `overflow_dropped_utterance_count` and `evicted_pending_utterance_count` stay at zero under normal speaking pace;
- the exact Meeting Microphone route remains ready and selectable by the meeting application.

### 3. C0 — first Start with built-in voice

From a stopped state, press **Start Translation** once and measure wall-clock **Start → Live**. Do not double-click Start.

Record whether Start is cold (models not yet resident) or warm (same app process after successful runtime use). Repeat one warm Start only after a clean Stop so cold/warm behavior is distinguishable.

### 4. C1 — outbound end-to-end timing

With Translation Live, speak 10–20 representative utterances. Include short phrases and normal meeting-length sentences; do not use an artificial stress script as the only sample.

Use the current Diagnostics timing surfaced from Meeting outbound status and record at least several representative turns:

| Timing | Meaning | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `speech_boundary_ms` | detected end-silence contribution | |
| `finalization_ms` | finalized speech → queued target frame | |
| `queue_ms` | wait before serialized outbound processing | |
| `audio_prepare_ms` | temporary ASR audio preparation | |
| `asr_ms` | finalized audio → transcript | |
| `translation_ms` | transcript → completed translation | |
| `tts_ms` | translated text → generated voice WAV | |
| `delivery_ms` | output delivery start → first playback | |
| `outbound_latency_ms` | finalized utterance → first translated playback | |

Also record:

- callback error count;
- overflow-dropped utterance count;
- evicted-pending utterance count;
- any failed/stale/interrupted turn;
- whether the meeting application actually receives the translated voice.

The official user-relevant latency metric remains `outbound_latency_ms`; stage timing exists to identify its owner.

### 5. Hardware pressure

Observe the TranslateIT/Rust process and its Python worker during these phases:

```text
app idle
→ Start / functional readiness
→ Live listening with no speech
→ ASR
→ translation
→ TTS
→ delivery
```

Use Windows Task Manager and, when available for NVIDIA, `nvidia-smi` or an equivalent trusted local monitor. Capture **steady and peak** values rather than one averaged number:

| Phase | Rust CPU | Python CPU | Rust RAM | Python RAM | GPU util | VRAM |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Idle | | | | | | |
| Start | | | | | | |
| Live listening | | | | | | |
| ASR | | | | | | |
| Translation | | | | | | |
| TTS | | | | | | |
| Delivery | | | | | | |

### 6. Optional incoming isolation

After the outbound-only baseline is healthy, enable the intended Meeting Sound source and repeat several outbound utterances while English incoming speech is present.

Confirm:

- required outbound remains responsive and takes scheduler priority;
- incoming may defer/degrade without breaking outbound;
- TranslateIT's own English TTS is not re-consumed as incoming translation;
- stale incoming backlog does not grow unbounded.

### 7. C4 — Stop lifecycle

Press Stop while idle, then once while an utterance is being processed.

Confirm output authority is revoked immediately, no stale translated audio is emitted afterward, microphone/Meeting Sound resources release, and the app reaches a truthful stopped state.

### 8. C5 — repeated-session stability

Run at least five normal Start → speak → Stop cycles in the same app process. Record each Start → Live duration and whether the Python worker stayed warm or had to restart after an in-flight hard cancellation.

A repeated-session issue is actionable only when its owner is visible: Start preflight, helper restart/cold load, audio-route opening, capture opening, or cleanup.

## Decision rules after the baseline

Use the measured owner instead of applying speculative architecture changes:

- **Start functional probe:** optimize/reuse it only if Start → Live is materially dominated by repeated functional verification on an otherwise unchanged healthy worker. Any reuse must remain bound to worker generation, selected actor identity, and current prerequisites; do not replace functional truth with file presence.
- **Model residency:** keep ASR/MiLMMT/GPT-SoVITS warm when RAM/VRAM pressure is acceptable. Consider selective residency only if measured pressure is the practical limiter; do not trade normal per-utterance latency for theoretical memory savings.
- **Temporary WAV transport:** keep the simpler file boundary when `audio_prepare_ms`/delivery preparation is negligible relative to AI stages. Consider memory/shared transport only when the measured file boundary is material and the replacement can preserve cancellation, privacy, and bounded memory.
- **Audio callback/VAD:** revisit callback/buffer work when callback errors, capture instability, abnormal CPU while only listening, or drop/eviction counters reproduce independently of heavy AI inference.
- **Polling/UI:** optimize only if profiling shows UI/IPC is a measurable contributor; it is not a proxy for Meeting latency.

## Completion

This run is complete when one exact SHA has:

1. real microphone/finalization/route evidence;
2. real outbound stage timing;
3. real CPU/RAM/GPU/VRAM observations;
4. one clean Stop and repeated-session evidence;
5. a named first bottleneck, or evidence that no additional source optimization is currently justified.

Return only the measured first bottleneck to development. Do not reopen every previously considered optimization at once.
