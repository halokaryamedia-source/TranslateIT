# TranslateIT Agent Routing

Repository state is authoritative. Chat history and old evidence are supporting context only.

## Branch and execution authority

**Local-only repository model:** `Local` is the sole active repository authority for development, governance, CI, proof, continuation, and release-source validation.

- Material GitHub work follows root `GITHUB_RULES.md`.
- Do not fall back to `main` or another branch for current source, proof, or continuation.
- Do not create alternate development branches as part of the normal method.
- Historical branches/reports are recovery evidence only and are not current task or product authority.

## Execution Context Gate

Classify by actual capability:

```text
CONTEXT: REMOTE_GITHUB
CONTEXT: LOCAL_CODE
CONTEXT: TARGET_WINDOWS
```

```text
REMOTE_GITHUB  = repository + GitHub CI
LOCAL_CODE     = exact checkout + development toolchain/filesystem
TARGET_WINDOWS = LOCAL_CODE + installed TranslateIT + real Windows GPU/audio/device/meeting environment
```

Proof ceiling follows actual context. Exhaust the `REMOTE_GITHUB`-valid partition before handing off only genuinely higher-context residue.

## Observe / recover context

For `amati`, inspect, audit, understand, or recovery:

```text
AGENTS.md
→ GITHUB_RULES.md Core Rules
→ CONTEXT.md / next-action only if material
→ smallest owner
→ report
→ STOP
```

Read-only means no edit, CI trigger, continuation advance, or execution of the recorded next step.

## Work mode after context

### Bounded Maintenance

Use for a concrete bug, stale rule, stale test, CI-routing defect, or behavior-preserving cleanup.

```text
Goal
Failure Classification / first wrong owner
Acceptance
Proof Required
STOP Condition
```

### Standard Development

Use when requirement and semantic owner are clear but work exceeds bounded maintenance.

```text
Goal
Success Metric
Forbidden Proxy / Non-Goal
First Evidence Required / first wrong owner
In Scope / Out of Scope
Execution Partition / higher-context residue
Proof Required
STOP Condition
```

### Complex / Ambiguous Development

Use `.agents/skills/development-brief/SKILL.md` for architecture/redesign, unclear or cross-owner requirements, material public contracts, unresolved success criteria, quality/efficiency work, or a change whose safe boundary cannot be expressed by the Standard contract.

### Plan

Use when a high-impact product/architecture/release decision remains unresolved.

```text
recover current Local authority
→ inspect smallest relevant evidence
→ resolve/present the decision
→ NO IMPLEMENTATION
→ STOP
```

No silent transition from Plan to Development.

## Specialist budget

Canonical project skills are:

```text
development-brief
desktop-runtime-development
desktop-ui-design-development
local-ai-runtime-development
windows-audio-runtime-development
release-packaging-development
```

Budget:

```text
Bounded Maintenance → zero/one specialist when diagnosis needs it
Standard Development → zero/one specialist
Complex Development → development-brief + zero/one specialist
Plan / Context Recovery → none by default
```

Choose by semantic responsibility, not language/framework/library names.

## Semantic routing

```text
desktop shell/navigation/readiness/settings/bridge
→ desktop-runtime-development

visual hierarchy/layout/tokens/component states/rendered UI
→ desktop-ui-design-development

ASR/translation/TTS/model/AI worker/runtime
→ local-ai-runtime-development

physical mic/capture/VAD/Windows devices/Meeting route
→ windows-audio-runtime-development

installer/private Python/runtime assets/models/provider delivery
→ release-packaging-development
```

If investigation reveals a second independent problem, finish/reframe the current boundary instead of stacking specialists.

## Canonical state owners

| Information | Owner |
|---|---|
| GitHub/ref/history/CI/security/transfer/retry/STOP | `GITHUB_RULES.md` |
| Agent mode/context/routing/skill budget | `AGENTS.md` |
| Current product/repository orientation | `CONTEXT.md` |
| Current product/system law | `docs/foundation/` |
| Active continuation + one next step | `docs/knowledge/next-action.md` |
| Current proof interpretation | `docs/knowledge/current-validation.md` |
| Responsibility → current source owner | `docs/knowledge/source-ownership.md` |
| Durable decisions/reasons | `docs/knowledge/decisions/` |
| Operational runbooks | `docs/knowledge/operations/` |
| Skill inventory/routing | `docs/knowledge/skills/` |
| Actual behavior | current `Local` source + matching proof |

Do not create parallel status, plan, TODO, completion, review-state, roadmap, or session-memory systems.

## Source precedence

1. current explicit user instruction for task intent/new decision;
2. current `docs/foundation/` law;
3. current `Local` source + matching proof for actual implementation behavior;
4. target evidence for target-only claims;
5. `next-action.md` for continuation;
6. `source-ownership.md` for navigation;
7. `CONTEXT.md` for current orientation;
8. `docs/knowledge/decisions/` for durable why/history;
9. Git history as bounded recovery evidence.

Conflict handling:

```text
foundation vs source
→ desired behavior vs implementation gap

current user decision vs foundation
→ reconcile foundation first

next-action vs source
→ source wins for implementation state
→ reconcile stale continuation

historical evidence vs current owner
→ current owner wins unless history is explicitly revalidated
```

## Root-cause and minimum-complete gate

Before a material edit establish:

1. what happens now;
2. first wrong owner;
3. expected behavior;
4. why the proposed change addresses that owner;
5. cheapest proof that can falsify the result.

Every persistent file/module/dependency/config/fallback/cache/workflow/state must trace to the goal, acceptance, required contract, proved cause, or required proof.

Do not hide unknown causes with blind retry, arbitrary delay, broad catch/fallback, parallel services, compatibility aliases, duplicate state, or generic frameworks.

## Evidence language

Use only evidence labels supported by the execution context:

```text
SOURCE VERIFIED
LOCAL CODE VERIFIED
TARGET WINDOWS VERIFIED
LOCAL PROOF REQUIRED
TARGET WINDOWS PROOF REQUIRED
UNSUPPORTED
UNKNOWN
```

Build success is not runtime success. Hosted Windows is not automatically target-PC proof. Historical proof is not current proof unless the claim and source identity still match.

## User-facing reporting

For material work:

```text
Status: Selesai | Perlu pemeriksaan | Terhenti
Hasil:
Bukti:
Batasan:
Next step:
```

Use exactly one `Next step` when work remains. Update only canonical owners whose actual state changed, then STOP.
