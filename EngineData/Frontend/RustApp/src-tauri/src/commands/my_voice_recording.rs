    (102, "The fastest solution isn't always the best one, especially when a shortcut creates extra work that someone has to handle later."),

    (112, "We tested the microphone in a quiet room, then repeated the same sentence with a fan running softly in the background."),
    (113, "When I joined the call this morning, the first thing I noticed was that everyone sounded clear and the delay was much lower."),
    (114, "The team agreed to keep the design simple, remove the unnecessary steps, and spend more time testing the parts that users actually notice."),
    (115, "I can explain the main idea in a few words, but I can also give more detail if the team needs a complete technical explanation."),
    (116, "The customer asked a simple question, but the answer depended on several details that we needed to verify before giving a confident response."),
    (117, "We reviewed the schedule together, moved two tasks to next week, and kept the final delivery date because the remaining work was still manageable."),
    (118, "I usually speak a little more slowly when I mention a name, a date, or a number because those details are easy to miss."),
    (119, "The new version starts faster, uses less memory, and feels smoother during normal use, but we still need to test longer sessions."),
    (120, "If the first plan doesn't work, we can try the simpler option tomorrow and compare the results before making a final decision."),
    (121, "The meeting was almost finished when someone raised one last question, so we stayed a few minutes longer to make sure the answer was clear."),
    (122, "I can hear a small difference between the two recordings. The second one sounds warmer, while the first one sounds slightly brighter and more distant."),
    (123, "We started with a rough idea, tested it with a few people, learned what was confusing, and then simplified the experience before the next review."),
    (124, "Sometimes a short answer is enough, but other times I need to explain the background so everyone understands why the decision matters."),
    (125, "I try to keep the same calm tone whether I'm asking a question, sharing an opinion, or explaining something that needs more detail."),
    (126, "If the team finds a serious problem during testing, we should describe exactly what happened, reproduce it carefully, and fix the cause instead of hiding the symptom."),
    (127, "I appreciate clear feedback, even when it challenges my first idea, because a better result matters more than defending a decision that no longer makes sense."),
    (128, "That's everything I wanted to cover today. If anything is still unclear, we can return to it later instead of rushing through the final few points."),
