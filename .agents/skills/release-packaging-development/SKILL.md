# Release Packaging Development

## Current release shape

```text
working source
→ controlled release staging
→ TranslateIT-Setup.exe + TranslateIT-Payload.7z
→ installed TranslateIT on Windows
```

Normal users do not manually install Python, run pip, download core models, extract runtime folders or operate GPT-SoVITS tooling.

## Owns

- installer/package configuration;
- private Python runtime + locked runtime dependencies;
- required ASR/translation/GPT-SoVITS/built-in voice assets;
- deterministic installed resource layout;
- VB-CABLE/provider delivery boundary;
- fresh UserData initialization and uninstall/reinstall behavior;
- third-party licenses/notices/source provenance;
- clean-machine deployment proof.

## Rules

- Packaging difficulty does not justify a second runtime architecture.
- Repository/dev paths are not production resolution fallbacks.
- Model/runtime assets outside Git remain controlled release inputs.
- Installer generated ≠ installed runtime verified ≠ clean-machine verified.
- Never package historical docs, user recordings, private logs, developer secrets or test user data.
- Build-time tools do not become user runtime dependencies without product need.
- Built-in LibriSpeech/OpenSLR references are CC-BY-4.0 material; release provenance/attribution must preserve exact source/utterance/hash/license metadata. Do not call them public domain.
- Provider notice presence does not itself prove redistribution rights.

## Proof hierarchy

```text
configuration/source proof
→ artifact build proof
→ installed-runtime proof
→ clean-machine proof
```

Use only the level needed by the claim.
